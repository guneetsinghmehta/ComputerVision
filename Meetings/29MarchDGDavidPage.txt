Meeting with David Page
1. Try deep learning with auto encoders
2. Andrew Ng's tutorial on Deep Learning
3 Try Thiano - software for deep learning. Also 4 -5 others are there
4. Dataset - try to get a labelled dataset for the images
5. Multi Instance Learning - find regions in hte shirt and assign a vector to each region. 
Match the sub regions of the images in the dataset withthe query image and depending on the vote you giveselect the image from dataaset
6. Construct more reliable features- either from already extracted features or new features altogether.
