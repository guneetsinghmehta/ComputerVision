Ideas for the project report
1. MEntion the timeline like that in image search paper - From thousands to Billions in 20 years
2. 

Papers to be read
1 relevance feedback [Rui et al. 1998]. 
2. survey  in Zhou and Huang [2003]
3. Torralba et al. [2008a] collected 80 million images and demonstrated an impressive performance by employing a simple k-nearest neighbor search and voting strategy
4—Feature. In 1999, Lowe [1999] proposed a new method called the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 
5—Index. In 1999, Gionis et al. [1999] developed a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique, an efficient solution for the high-dimensional k-nearest neighbor search problem, 
6—System. In 2001, Google launched its image search system for 250 million Web images, which 
7  excellent surveys for image retrieval in the early
years [Rui et al. 1999; Smeulders et al. 2000; Lew et al. 2006; Datta et al. 2008]
8  vector de-scriptors [Mikolajczyk et al. 2005],
9 Image as a bag of words - Sivic and Zisserman
10 Landmark Recognition - Zheng et al
11 Duplicate based image based search - Wang et al
12 Shape based image retrieval (Cao et al 2011) and recognition (Sun et al 2012)

Fun points 
1. Google's first Image search was based on the texts surrounding the image like the URL,metadata
2. Can use the surrounding text near images as weak features for the image itself -
